<h1>A Busy Day at the City Market</h1>

<p>
Last Saturday, Tom and his sister Anna went to the <span class="vocab">market</span> with their mother. 
The market was very <span class="vocab">crowded</span> and full of people. 
Tom felt <span class="highlight">excited</span> because he loves to see new things.
</p>

<p>
At the entrance, they saw a big man selling fresh <span class="vocab">fruit</span> and colorful vegetables. 
There were red apples, yellow bananas, green peppers, and big orange carrots. 
The smell was wonderful and very <span class="highlight">fresh</span>.
</p>

<p>
Anna wanted to buy some <span class="vocab">flowers</span>. She likes pink and white roses. 
Her mother gave her some money and said, “Be <span class="highlight">careful</span> and stay near us.” 
Anna chose a small bunch of beautiful flowers and felt very happy.
</p>

<p>
Tom stopped in front of a toy shop. He saw small cars, funny dolls, and colorful balloons. 
He asked his mother, “Can I buy one blue balloon, please?”  
His mother smiled and said yes. Tom felt <span class="highlight">proud</span> walking around with his new balloon.
</p>

<p>
After one hour, the family felt <span class="vocab">hungry</span>.  
They sat at a little table and ate delicious sandwiches.  
Tom drank cold apple juice and Anna had sweet orange juice.  
They talked, laughed, and enjoyed their <span class="highlight">time together</span>.
</p>

<p>
Before going home, their mother checked the shopping list again.  
They bought bread, milk, eggs, and some rice.  
Finally, they got into the car and drove back home.  
Everyone was tired but very <span class="highlight">satisfied</span> after a nice family day.
