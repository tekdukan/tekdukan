<h1>The School Science Fair</h1>

<p>
Last week, Emily had a very <span class="highlight">special</span> day at school.  
Her class was preparing for the yearly <span class="vocab">science fair</span>.  
All the students were busy making interesting projects.
</p>

<p>
Emily decided to make a project about the <span class="vocab">solar system</span>.  
She used paper, glue, and colorful balls to make the planets.  
Her favorite planet is Saturn because it has beautiful <span class="highlight">rings</span>.
</p>

<p>
Her best friend Jack made a project about plants.  
He brought small green plants in pots and explained how they grow.  
He told everyone that plants need water, light, and good <span class="vocab">soil</span> to live.
</p>

<p>
On Friday morning, many parents came to visit the fair.  
The school hall was full of noise and happy voices.  
Emily felt a little <span class="highlight">nervous</span>, but also very proud of her work.
</p>

<p>
When it was Emily’s turn, she stood next to her project and talked clearly.  
She explained the names of the planets and showed how they move around the sun.  
Her teacher said, “Great job, Emily! You worked very <span class="highlight">hard</span>.”
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, Emily got a small gold star for her project.  
She went home feeling very <span class="vocab">confident</span> and happy.  
She learned that learning new things can be fun and <span class="highlight">exciting</span>.
